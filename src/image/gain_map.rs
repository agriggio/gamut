//! A gain map: the second picture a phone's photograph carries, saying how
//! far above SDR white each pixel went, and how far it is applied.
//!
//! The base picture is the graded SDR photograph every viewer has always
//! shown, and the map beside it — usually a quarter of the base's size, one
//! or three 8-bit samples a pixel — is a per-pixel log2 multiplier that,
//! applied in linear light, puts back the highlights grading compressed.
//! Two containers carry one, an Ultra HDR JPEG and a HEIF, and each reads
//! its own metadata into a [`Lift`]: ISO 21496-1's, which Ultra HDR's XMP
//! and a HEIF's `tmap` item both spell, or Apple's headroom for the map in
//! an older iPhone's HEIC.
//!
//! The map is not applied when the file is decoded. What it is applied
//! *by* is the display: the standard's weight is where the display's own
//! headroom sits between the base's and the alternate's, so a monitor in
//! SDR mode, with no room above white, gets the base exactly as the phone
//! graded it, and a monitor with room gets as much of the lift as it has
//! room for. The base and the map go to the GPU as they are, and the lift
//! happens in the shader at the weight the surface asks for, which is what
//! lets the room switch without the file being read again — and what keeps
//! a 24-megapixel photograph at four bytes a pixel rather than sixteen.
//!
//! A camera raw's profile is a lift too, of another kind: the exposure, the
//! local tone map and the tone curve a DNG says the camera rendered its
//! picture with ([`Lift::Profile`]). It is worked out when the raw is
//! developed, a ratio a channel for every pixel of the picture
//! ([`Data::Ratios`]), and read through the same machinery — the shader,
//! the readout, the statistics and the copy — at a weight that is the
//! switch's, on or off, rather than the display's room.
//!
//! [`Table`] is what a weight makes of the map: the linear gain each of its
//! 256 values stands for. It is worked out once on the CPU, in
//! [`GainMap::table`], and goes to the shader as a lookup texture, so the
//! two sides cannot disagree about what a value means; and
//! [`GainMap::gain_at`] is the CPU twin of the shader's sampling of the
//! map, for the readout, the statistics and the copy, which have to say
//! what the screen shows.
